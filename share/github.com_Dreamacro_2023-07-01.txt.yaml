v1.14.0











Feature

support vmess 'zero' security (#2513) @fakeboboliu
migration go1.20
add meanDelay field on delay API.
add support for dns search domains for A/AAAA (#2597) @jeff-an

Change

remove redir-host as config. since redir-host brings a lot of misunderstandings and problems (some of which are even hard to find). I decided to remove it. It is only used in the fake-ip-filter for a few domain name mappings. I know that it can be bypassed and "recovered" in fake-ip mode. If fake-ip-filter finds that it has been abused, I will delete the domain mapping mode completely.

Bugfixes

fix a fakeip udp bug, and you can try removing some of the fake-ip-filter lists for the game
modify local ip to pass all test (#2595) @daveyuuuu

response without fakeip and hosts, can be used to debug dns issues

experimental:
