v1.14.0











Feature

support vmess 'zero' security (#2513) @fakeboboliu
migration go1.20
add meanDelay field on delay API.
add support for dns search domains for A/AAAA (#2597) @jeff-an

Change

remove redir-host as config. since redir-host brings a lot of misunderstandings and problems (some of which are even hard to find). I decided to remove it. It is only used in the fake-ip-filter for a few domain name mappings. I know that it can be bypassed and "recovered" in fake-ip mode. If fake-ip-filter finds that it has been abused, I will delete the domain mapping mode completely.

Bugfixes

fix a fakeip udp bug, and you can try removing some of the fake-ip-filter lists for the game
modify local ip to pass all test (#2595) @daveyuuuu

Feature

REDIRECT support IPv6 (#2473) @embeddedlove
add dns query json API (/dns/query)

response refer Google Public DNS and Cloudflare
response without fakeip and hosts, can be used to debug dns issues


add riscv64 build

Change

Since the previous udp fallback behavior caused a lot of troubles and problems, in this release, udp matching no longer performs fallback matching and drop packet by default. If you need this behavior, use the following configuration.

experimental:
  udp-fallback-match: true

skip cache acme-challenge dns msg (#2469) @ffy

Bugfixes

drop UDP packet which mismatched destination for VMess (#2410) @ssz66666
